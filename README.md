# NotifyMe iOS App

## Overview
This is the iOS application designed to receive Apple push notifications from
APNS in conjunction with the rest of the NotifyMe environment, as well as
viewing the list of alerts forwarded to that device. 

## Motivation
I started this app out of a desire to learn about Apple's Push Notification
Service. I also desired to build it because of a number of programs and events
I wanted alerts for. Using terminal or any other program that can connect to a
web service, you can send alerts to your device. Server rebooted? Get an alert!

## Installation
This is an iOS App. If you are an Apple Developer, I suppose you could install
this app yourself. However, I _highly_ do not recommend this. This app is still
a work in progress. Currently, its only functionality is the ability to create
an account, log in, register the device with the account, and recieve
notifications. There is no way to view a list of the notifications, and as the
terminal program to send notifications is also a work in progress, I don't see
why you could want this.
